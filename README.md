# **Gainz – Gamified Fitness Tracking App**

Gainz is more than a fitness tracker — it’s a fitness _game_.
The goal is simple: make working out fun, rewarding, and addictive through smart gamification and consistent feedback loops.

## Core Concept

### **RPG-Style Progression**

- Pick a class (Monk, Gladiator, etc.), each with unique stat growth paths.
- Log workouts to earn XP and level up.
- Achievements, milestones, and dynamic upgrades form the main “game loop.”

### **Dynamic Quests**

</p>
- Quests turn workouts into structured missions.
- Completing them grants XP, boosts, or in-game rewards.

### **Challenge Your Friends**

- Add friends to unlock leaderboards, guilds, group quests, PvE challenges, and PvP duels.
- Cosmetics, gifts, and events keep the world feeling alive and competitive.

### **Practical Fitness Tools**

Core fitness features stay useful and grounded:

- Workout libraries
- Record tracking
- Manual tracking
  All seamlessly tie back into the game mechanics.

## **Why Build This?**

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Most fitness apps are passive: </span>they track, record, and store—but rarely _motivate_.
Gainz bridges that gap by making fitness fun, competitive, and social.
Instead of just logging workouts, users feel the satisfaction of progression, leveling up, and “playing” their fitness journey.

## **Tech Stack & Approach**

Gainz will be built with a modular, iterative workflow:

- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend:** Rust
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Architecture:** RESTful API with independent frontend/backend development
- **Testing:** Continuous feedback loops + usability testing + prototype refinement

Prototyping will start in Figma, move to interactive testing, and finally transition into full feature development.
